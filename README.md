# ToDoApp
Welcome to the first flask app I ever built in my coding journey - the 100% original, never before seen: To Do App! 

Utilizing Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS, SQLite and SQLAlchemy I've built a user-friendly interface that allows you to add, update, and delete to-do list items. As you use the app, you'll see live stats on your task progress, keeping things engaging and functional

This project demonstrates a practical application featuring basic CRUD operations in a database-driven system
