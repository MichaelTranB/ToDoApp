# ToDoApp
Welcome to my first flask - To Do App
Utilizing Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS, I've built a user-friendly interface that allows you to add, update, and delete to-do list items

As you use the app, you'll see live stats on your task progress, keeping things engaging and functional

This project demonstrates a practical application featuring basic CRUD operations in a database-driven system
